# FoodImageClassification

This project aimed to classify 80 different food categories from 30612 images with deep learning architecture. First, I experiemted with developing a CNN and trained from scratch. However, as a single model performance seems to perform poorly, I decided to leverage other pretrained models for transfer learning, including VGG16, Xception, InceptionV16, and MobileNetV2. I freezed the top 10 layers to keep some primitive features, and additonaled 4 new layers were also added, including dropout to prevent overfitting. Image data augmentation was also applied to the learning, including zoom, rotation, channel shift, horizontal flip. This step aims to expand the training dataset to improve the performance and ability of the model to generalize. Finally, I used an ensemble method to improve performance by combining predictions from multiple models. The ensemble method averages out the outputs for all these four models and successfully reduce the variance of neural network models. After the average ensembel method, the final accuracy rate went up to 65% at the test set on Kaggle submission. The above-mentioned approach method is performed in [transfer_learning.ipynb](https://github.com/lalaique/FoodImageClassification/blob/main/transfer_learning.ipynb).
