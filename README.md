# Food Image Classification

This project aims to classify 80 different food categories from 30612 images with deep learning architecture. First, a single convolutionl neural network is experimented and trained from scratch. However, as a single model performance seems to perform poorly, I decide to leverage other pretrained models for transfer learning, including VGG16, Xception, InceptionV16, and MobileNetV2. The top 10 layers are frozen to keep some primitive features, and additonaled 4 new layers are also added, including dropout to prevent overfitting. Image data augmentation is also applied to the learning, including zoom, rotation, channel shift, horizontal flip. This step aims to expand the training dataset to improve the performance and ability of the model to generalize. Finally, I use an ensemble method to improve performance by combining predictions from multiple models. The ensemble method averages out the outputs for all these four models and successfully reduce the variance of neural network models. After the average ensembel method, the final accuracy rate goes up to 65% at the test set. The above-mentioned approach method is performed in [transfer_learning.ipynb](https://github.com/lalaique/FoodImageClassification/blob/main/transfer_learning.ipynb).
